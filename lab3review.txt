Correct SQL statements
Correct output for some queries
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  SELECT *
  FROM Products
  WHERE Products.city not In('Dallas') and Products.city not In('Duluth') and Products.priceUSD >= 1.00;
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city NOT IN ('Dallas', 'Duluth')
    AND priceUSD >= 1.00;



5. List the names of agents not in New York and not in Tokyo.

Incorrect output
- It seems like you did not read the correct instructions for this query. Read
  it again, please.


In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.
