Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct queries
Mostly correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries like this:
  SELECT DISTINCT pid
  FROM orders
  WHERE aid IN (SELECT aid
                FROM orders
                WHERE cid IN (SELECT cid
                              FROM customers
                              WHERE city = 'Dallas'))
  ORDER BY pid DESC;     -- < notice the correct indentation here


3. Get the ids and names of customers who did not place an order through agent
a01.

Incorrect output
- Logic has flaws


7. Get all customers who have the same discount as that of any customers in
Dallas or London

Incorrect output
- You overcomplicated things here a bit


8. Tell me about check constraints: What are they? What are they good for? What
is the advantage of putting that sort of thing inside the database? Make up
some examples of good uses of check constraints and some examples of bad uses
of check constraints. Explain the differences in your examples and argue your
case.

- You did not include -actual- check constraints examples, just descriptions of
  them. 


In general: 

- Please do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.
